### INSTALLING ###

In order to transfer Cesium to your calculator, you must have a linking program, such as TI-Connect CE: https://education.ti.com/ticonnectce. Once installed:

1. Plug-in your calculator and Launch TI-Connect CE
2. Select the two programs, `Cesium.8xp` and `A.8xp` downloaded from here (or `Cesium_French.8xp` if needed)
3. Drag'n'drop them onto the calculator that should be in the devices list in TI-Connect CE
4. Press the [Send] button in the window that pops up.

Congratulations, Cesium is now on your calculator!  

### RUNNING ###
All you need to do to run Cesium is to press [PGRM],[ENTER],[ENTER] in order to load prgmA.  
If you are still unsure of what to do, simply press the [PGRM] button, select the option that says 1:A, and press enter.  

The first time Cesium is run, it needs to copy some files to the archive to help with stability.  
Once you get a "Cesium Installed" message, simply press [ENTER] again.  
Now Cesium can be run at any time by running the prgmA.

### NAVIGATION ###
Cesium provides a way to quickly jump to different programs in the program browser. Simply press one of the keys with a green letter above it, and it will take you to the first program with that starts with that letter.
* [2ND/ENTER] - Run, select  
* [ALPHA] - Edit program options  
* [MODE] - Enter settings menu  
* [UP/DOWN] - Move places  
* [Key with green letter] - Alpha search
 
### RUNNING PROGRAMS ###
Cesium can run programs written in ASM, C, or BASIC, either from the archive or not. It is prefered that you place programs in the archive, as it will protect them against RAM clears.  
To run a program, simply press [2ND] or [Enter]. After a program is finished running, it will return to Cesium.

### RESTORING ###
To protect against the case of a RAM clear, Cesium archives itself. To unarchive it, press [2ND],[+],[2],[7], and make sure there isn't an asterisk next to CESIUM.  
To reload, simply go to the program menu and run with the `Asm(` command, findable in the catalog with [2ND],[0]. The homescreen should look like this:
`Asm(prgmCESIUM`  
Press [Enter]. Now, Cesium recreated `prgmA` for you, so use that on your next load.

### UNINSTALLING ###
To uninstall Cesium, just press [2ND],[+],[2],[1] and delete the following files:
* A      (Program)
* CESIUM (Program)
* CeOS   (AppVar)
* Cesium (AppVar)
