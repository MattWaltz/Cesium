## Cesium

Cesium is the first *shell* for the TI-84 Plus CE / TI-83 Premium CE calculators, and includes many useful features.

### Installing

In order to transfer Cesium to your calculator, you must have a linking program, such as TI-Connect CE: https://education.ti.com/ticonnectce. Once installed:

1. Plug-in your calculator and Launch TI-Connect CE
2. Send `cesium.8xp` (or `cesium_french.8xp` if needed)
3. Drag'n'drop them onto the calculator that should be in the devices list in TI-Connect CE
4. Press the [Send] button in the window that pops up.

Congratulations, Cesium is now on your calculator!

### Running
For the first run, execute Cesium as you would any other assembly program by pressing [2nd][0] and choosing the `Asm(` token.
Then press [prgm] and choose `CESIUM`. The homescreen should look like this:

    Asm(prgmCESIUM

Press [enter] to execute.

**NOTE:** The `Cesium` application is accessible with the [apps] button; *not* with the [prgm] button.

Once installed, the application cannot be transferred to other calculators. If you wish to transfer Cesium to other calculators after installation, you must resend the installer and transfer the installer to other calculators.
Another strategy is to make a group object ([2nd][+][8], type in a group name) that contains the installer and a random, small file (L1, for instance).  Then, the group can be transferred and ungrouped (same procedure, just scroll to "UNGROUP" in the menu and select the group with the installer) and the installer run.

### Controls
Cesium provides a way to quickly jump to different programs in the program browser. Simply press one of the keys with a green letter above it, and it will take you to the first program with that starts with that letter.

| Combination     | Action                   |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| [2nd/enter]     | Run, select              |
| [alpha]         | Edit program options     |
| [mode]          | Enter settings menu      |
| [up/down]       | Move places              |
| [Green letters] | Alpha search for program |

### Shortcuts
Shortcuts are available from the TI-OS system anywhere. Simply hold the [on] key and press the corresponding button to trigger the action.
Available actions:

| Combination | Action                                                     |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| [on]+[prgm] | Launch Cesium Application                                  |
| [on]+[stat] | Power down with password on wake (Default password - 5555) |

You can change the password from the settings menu (Accessed using [mode]), and pressing the [sto->] button. This will prompt for a new password which will be automatically saved.

### External Backup
Cesium also offers the ability to externally back up the RAM from within the OS. These are also tied to the shortcuts:

**PLEASE DO NOT USE THESE FOR TRIVIAL ISSUES. THEY MAY CAUSE UNINTENDED WEAR ON THE FLASH CHIP, SO BE SURE TO MODERATE USEAGE.**
**THE FLASH CHIP IS ONLY DESIGNED TO SUPPORT 100,000+ ERASE CYCLES**

| Combination | Action                                                     |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| [on]+[8]    | Backup RAM from TI-OS                                      |
| [on]+[5]    | Remove latest RAM backup                                   |
| [on]+[2]    | Restore RAM from latest backup                             |

### Running Programs
Cesium can run programs written in ASM, C, ICE, or BASIC, either from the archive or not. It is prefered that you place programs in the archive, as it will protect them against RAM clears.
To run a program, simply press [2ND] or [Enter]. After a program is finished running, it will return to Cesium.

### Features
* Running ASM, C, and Basic programs directly, and they can be archived or not
* [Un]Archiving, deleting, hiding, and renaming programs
* Catalog-like searching for programs for quick lookup
* Ability to hide then run indicator when running Basic programs
* Support implemented for relocatable shared C and ASM libraries
* Customizable icons for all file types (DoorsCS format)
* Battery indicator and clock
* Customizable colors/theme
* Available in French and English

### Uninstalling
To uninstall Cesium, press [2nd][+][2][1] and delete the Cesium Application.

### Building
You can easily build Cesium by navigating in the `src` directory and entering the command:
**Make sure to place spasm.exe in the `src` folder!

https://github.com/alberthdev/spasm-ng/releases , rename spasm32.exe or spasm64.exe (for 64 bit systems) to spasm.exe

    spasm -E -DENGLISH=1 cesium.asm cesium.8xp && mv cesium.8xp ../cesium.8xp && spasm -E -DFRENCH=1 cesium.asm cesium.8xp && mv cesium.8xp ../cesium-french.8xp
    
Windows input:
    
    spasm -E -DENGLISH=1 cesium.asm cesium.8xp && move cesium.8xp ../cesium.8xp && spasm -E -DFRENCH=1 cesium.asm cesium.8xp && move cesium.8xp ../cesium-french.8xp
